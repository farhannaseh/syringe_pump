# syringe_pump
An alternative implementation of the OpenSyringe Pump software.

This program drives a DIY syringe pump based heavily on that from the [OpenSyringe Pump][1].
Code and help for the Big Easy Driver is [here][2].

Changes include:

 - The syringe pump rail is an assembled 300mm actuator kit from [MakerStore][3]
